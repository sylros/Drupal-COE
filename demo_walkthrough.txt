On the home page you will find a block with links to where you need to go for the demo

The link to "Orders" will allow you to create new orders, Click the "Create a new order" button

- Order type = HC Order (This is a customizable order, think of a content type that users can create to make orders)
- Customer = Type in the name of a Drupal user in the system you've created, preferably a user with a gmail account or another email client
that will receive emails
- Fill in the billing information with dummy data
- Add an order item - HC Invoice
  - Give it a title
  - Put in a price - Under 1000$
  - Click "Create Order Item"
  - Add another order if you want to
- Save the order

You be redirected to the new order's view page where you can see an invoice tab. Until you place the order that tab will be empty
At the bottom of the order's view page click the "Place Order" button and it will create an invoice of the current order

In the Invoice tab you can now see the invoice and select download invoice which will create a PDF of the invoice

In the payment tab you will be able to make a payment on the order. There should only be one gateway for payments and the customer that was
chosen for the order needs to a payment option added to his user account before making a payment

Go to the user's page in Drupal

There will be a Payment method tab where you can add a payment method for that user

Go here for test credit card credentials https://developer.moneris.com/en/More/Testing/Testing%20a%20Solution and any of the test card
credentials should work

Once the user has the method saved to there account they can make a payment by selecting the payment method - Make the test payment and the
system will create a new entity type with the response from Moneris

Go back to the home page and click the "Transactions" link and it will bring you to the server page for transactions - The most recent
transaction will be the one that was created when you made the payment and you can show this

Most of the information I don't even know what it means, but you can see the receipt ID, order ID, who the customer was, the amount and if
it was approved.

Go back to the search page for transactions and click the select / deselect all results button
In the dropdown menu above select one of the options to generate either a CSV or XLSX file of the search results
Hit "Apply to selected items" and you will get a notification at the top of the page to download the generated file

Open the file to show the spreadsheet with all the data from the view exported in the format selected.

Lastly to show the Moneris Hosted Pay Page go to the following page {drupal_root}/HHP.html and it will bring up the test page for hosted pay pages
Only the first two fields matter for the demo, make sure the Store ID and HPP Key are still valid. If the credentials don't work anymore, go to
the Moneris testsite and put in the information for store5 and go to the Hosted Paypage Configuration and click "Generate new configuration"

- Select to have Moneris provide a receipt and create the new configuration for testing.
